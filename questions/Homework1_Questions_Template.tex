\paragraph{Q1:} \textbf{[12 points]} 
We have been given special permission to use the telescope on the roof of Barus and Holley. Unfortunately, our fantastic image of the Orion nebula has noise caused by the imaging sensor: (\href{run:images/orion-noise.png}{orion-noise.png})

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth,height=6cm,keepaspectratio]
{images/orion-noise.png}
\end{center}

One way to deal with this noise is with image convolution. 
Convolution is a type of image filtering that is a fundamental image processing tool.


\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item 
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=orange!5!white,colframe=orange!75!black]
\emph{Explicitly describe} the input, transformation, and output components of 2D discrete convolution. Please be precise; define variables as need.

\paragraph{Q2:} \textbf{[6 points]} Now that we've de-noised our image of the Orion nebula, let's explore filtering techniques more closely. Two kinds of linear filtering are correlation and convolution.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]

    \item \textbf{[3 points]} 
    \begin{tcolorbox}[colback=orange!5!white,colframe=orange!75!black]
    What is different between convolution and correlation? Include differences in their algebraic properties. When might we use each? \textbf{[5--6 sentences]}
    \end{tcolorbox}
    
    \begin{tcolorbox}[colback=white!5!white,colframe=green!75!black]

    \clipbox{0pt \dimexpr\dp0-14\baselineskip\relax{} 0in 0pt}{\copy0}
    \end{tcolorbox}

    
    \item \textbf{[3 points]}
    To solidify our understanding of the distinction between correlation and convolution, we will process another image.
    
    \begin{tcolorbox}[colback=orange!5!white,colframe=orange!75!black]
    Devise a scenario in which the output of correlation and convolution differ.
    
    Write code that loads an image and produces two distinct images, one from convolution and one from correlation on some kernel of your choice. 
    
    Specify your kernel, and provide the input image and two output results. Then, use your understanding of convolution and correlation to explain the outputs. \textbf{[2--4 sentences]}
    \end{tcolorbox}
    
    \emph{Consider \href{https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.convolve2d.html}{$scipy.signal.convolve2d$} and \href{https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.correlate2d.html}{$scipy.signal.correlate2d$} to experiment!}

\paragraph{Q3:} \textbf{[13 points]} While exploring Brown CS's history in the halls of CIT, we happen upon Nancy: a DEC VAX 11/780. So struck by its beauty, we decide to take an artful photo with our camera. Modern digital sensors have many megapixels, so we resize it to make the file smaller.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item \textbf{[3 points]} Oh no! What happened to Nancy? There are weird artifacts in the vents (above red line)---these definitely weren't there in the original photo. Plus, if we look closely, the white label text is less smooth and there are jagged lines.

\paragraph{Q4:} \textbf{[14 points]} With filtering, we can create \emph{hybrid images} that depict different objects when viewed at different distances. They are inauthentic images of the natural world.

As technology advances, evaluating the authenticity of images becomes increasingly difficult. Please read \href{https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/12/arts/photography-view-ask-it-no-questions-the-camera-can-lie.html}{this article} by photography critic Andy Grundberg in the \emph{New York Times} from August 1990.

Grundberg stated that: ``In the future, readers of newspapers and magazines will probably view news pictures more as illustrations than as reportage, since they can no longer distinguish between a genuine image and one that has been manipulated.''

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item \textbf{[4 points]}

    The Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA) has designed a technical specification to attach history to an image. Please watch \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hA0ZjqakEF8}{this video} for an overview; stop at 4 minutes and 40 seconds.
    \begin{tcolorbox}[colback=orange!5!white,colframe=orange!75!black]

\paragraph{Q5:} \textbf{Technical practice --- [7 points]}  In computer vision, each image is a matrix of pixels. The \texttt{numpy} library provides fast computation with large multi-dimensional vectors and matrices. 

To familiarize yourself with the library, read through the following scenarios and complete the exercises. Write \emph{one} \texttt{numpy} function to complete each of the following tasks.

With \texttt{numpy} imported as
\begin{verbatim}
    import numpy as np
\end{verbatim}
we can call functions with 
\begin{verbatim}
    np.function_name(<arguments>)
\end{verbatim}
Test out your answers by creating your own python program. Some functions you might find useful are \href{https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.squeeze.html}{np.squeeze}, \href{https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.expand_dims.html}{np.expand\_dims}, \href{https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.clip.html}{np.clip}, \href{https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.pad.html}{np.pad}, and \href{https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.zeros.html}{np.zeros}.

Use operators like \texttt{[]} and \texttt{:}, but remember that each prompt can be completed with only \textit{one} function/operator shorthand.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item \textbf{[1 point]} Create a black image \texttt{img} with all values in this matrix equal to 0. 
    
    \begin{tcolorbox}[colback=orange!5!white,colframe=orange!75!black]
    Create \texttt{img} where \texttt{np.shape(img) == (320,640)}.

    \item \textbf{[1 point]} A filtering operation seems to mess up the output dimensions, producing a variable \texttt{img\_out} where \texttt{np.shape(img\_out) == (1, 1, 320, 640)}.
    
    \begin{tcolorbox}[colback=orange!5!white,colframe=orange!75!black]
    Remove all 1-sized dimensions. Convert \texttt{img\_out} to a new matrix \texttt{img\_fixed} where \texttt{np.shape(img\_fixed) == (320, 640)}.

    \item \textbf{[1 point]} Color images are represented with three dimensions. The first dimension represents the number of color channels, and could help us to identify whether an image is color (RGB) or grayscale. 
    
    \begin{tcolorbox}[colback=orange!5!white,colframe=orange!75!black]
    Say you have a grayscale image \texttt{img} where \texttt{np.shape(img) == (320, 640)}. Convert this to a new image \texttt{img\_expanded} where \texttt{np.shape(img\_expanded) == (1, 320, 640)}. In other words, add a 1-sized dimension to \texttt{img}.

    \item \textbf{[1 point]} Assume we have a 2D matrix \texttt{img} with values rage [-1.0, 1.0]. 
    \begin{tcolorbox}[colback=orange!5!white,colframe=orange!75!black]
    Clip \texttt{img} so that all its values lie within the range [-0.5, 0.5].

    \item \textbf{[1 point]} Suppose we have an RGB image matrix, \texttt{img}, of shape (320, 640, 3). We call each color matrix a channel of information.
    \begin{tcolorbox}[colback=orange!5!white,colframe=orange!75!black]
    Retrieve the third blue channel of the image while preserving all of \texttt{img}'s dimensions and intensity values.

    \item \textbf{[1 point]} Suppose we have a second RGB image matrix, \texttt{img2}, also of shape (320, 640, 3).
    
    \begin{tcolorbox}[colback=orange!5!white,colframe=orange!75!black]
    Retrieve the red and blue channels of \texttt{img2} while preserving all of \texttt{img2}'s dimensions and intensity values.

    \item \textbf{[1 point]} Padding is a useful operation to help us produce a convolved image equal in size to an input image. 
    
    \begin{tcolorbox}[colback=orange!5!white,colframe=orange!75!black]
    Given an RGB image, \texttt{img}, pad it with two columns of zeros on the left and right edges of the image, and three rows of zeros on the top and bottom edges of the image. Do not add zeros to the color dimension.
